COMMAND-LINE-ARGUMENTS


HOMEPAGE

SEE ALSO

For a fancier take on the same general idea, see Didier Verna's CLON:

By comparison, this library has fewer features but is slightly more portable.


TODO

* Migrate to CLON?

* add documentation besides the comments in the code.

* add counter variables for verbosity flags:
  -v -v -v adds 3 to the default value.
  With minimum and maximum value caps in the finalizer.

* enhance layout of self-documentation
  Have an automatic layout strategy for self-documentation.
  Maybe output the kind of things that man(1) expects, groff(7),
  then actually integrate with the man system.
  Or else, build a general tool to display stuff on a terminal
  while respecting terminal width.
  Or output HTML and use lynx -dump or a browser.

* BUG: Apparently, when there is a missing string argument to a string option
  as in --string --bar we assign T to string argument --string instead of erroring out.

* Have an actual test suite. Sigh.

* Similar bug to fix, keeping a regression test:
  (process-command-line-options '(("export-model" :type boolean :optional nil)) '("--export-model" "no"))
